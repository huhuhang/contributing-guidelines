# Recommended Workflows

## Editor

You can use any editor, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has a lot of great features, including:

* Editing Code.
* Editing Markdown docs.
* Live Preview of Markdown docs.
* Git commands and GitHub built-in.
* Lots of extensions.

You can also use the Online Visual Studio Code provided by GitHub. Try to change the repo URL `https://github.com/labex-dev/devops-labs` to `https://github.dev/labex-dev/devops-labs`, and you will see the same interface as the desktop version.
